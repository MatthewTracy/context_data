nyin is a system of phonetic notation that uses the Latin alphabet to represent the sounds of Mandarin Chinese. It was developed in the 1950s to help non-native speakers learn how to pronounce Chinese words correctly and to standardize the spelling and pronunciation of Chinese words. Pinyin is often used alongside Chinese characters to help people read and understand Chinese text, and it is an important tool for learning Chinese as a second language. It consists of syllables, each Chinese character has one syllable, and syllables can have initials and finals, which are the equivalent of consonants and vowels in English.
